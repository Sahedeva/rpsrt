Rock Paper Scissors Real Time

This was my final project for my 12 week bootcamp. This was a solo project. I decided to use a new technology that we only covered for one day - Meteor. I wanted to use it's real time capabilities and from the intro videos and the first app demo it seemed relatively straight forward and easy to use. Unfortunately, once I got into the demands of my application and wanted to do things different from the demo apps, Meteor proved to be much more complicated.

My first chalenge was to set up a structure to the application. The demo apps have 3 files (js, html, css) and once my application started taking shape, those three files became unwieldy. I decided to build up a structure and created several new directories so that my client side and server side and shared files would be clearly delineated. That was one of the first things I struggled with in Meteor: the same code can run on both client and server.

Once the structural concerns were out of the way, I started my development process with ERDs so I could know the shape of my data and organize my database. I used the wall and dry erase markers to get a good visual.
